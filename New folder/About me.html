           <br>
            <p>
            I am an AKMI student, and I am inspired to write anime. Anime has always been a significant part of my life, and I have always been fascinated by the way it can tell compelling stories and convey powerful emotions through animation.
                 <br> <br>
                I have spent countless hours watching anime and studying its various styles and techniques, and I am eager to take my passion to the next level by creating my own anime series. I believe that anime has the power to bring people together and to inspire them to reach for their dreams, and I want to be a part of that.
                <br> <br>
                As an AKMI student, I am constantly learning new skills and techniques that will help me bring my vision to life. I am excited to explore the world of anime and to share my stories with the world. Whether I am creating action-packed fight scenes or heart-wrenching moments of emotional depth, I am committed to telling stories that will touch the hearts of my viewers and leave a lasting impact.</p>
