    Once upon a time, in a world where humans and demons coexisted, there was a boy named Kenji. Kenji lived in a small village surrounded by dense forests, where demonic beasts roamed freely. Despite the constant threat, the villagers managed to live in peace by relying on powerful mages to keep the beasts at bay.
    <br><br>
    Kenji, however, was not content with a life of fear and dependency. He yearned for strength and power, the kind that would allow him to protect his village and his loved ones. So, he decided to embark on a journey to become a powerful warrior.
    <br><br>
    Kenji trained relentlessly, pushing his body and mind to the limit. He learned various martial arts and sword fighting techniques, but he felt that something was missing. He lacked the ferociousness that he believed was necessary to defeat the demons.
    <br><br>
    One day, Kenji stumbled upon an old, abandoned shrine deep in the forest. He felt drawn to it and decided to explore it. Inside, he found a strange, ancient artifact that emitted an ominous aura. Without hesitation, he touched the artifact, and it triggered a sudden surge of power within him.
    <br><br>
    Kenji felt his body change, his muscles bulging, and his eyes turning red. He realized that he had embraced the ferociousness he had been seeking all along. With his newfound power, Kenji returned to his village, ready to face the demons head-on.
    <br><br>
    He charged into battle, his movements swift and savage, his strikes merciless. The demons trembled before him as he tore through their ranks with ease. The villagers watched in awe as Kenji single-handedly defeated the beasts that had terrorized them for so long.
    <br><br>
    As the last demon fell, Kenji looked around at the grateful and awestruck villagers. He realized that he had not only gained power but also the responsibility to protect those who could not protect themselves. From that day forward, Kenji became the village's protector, the ferocious warrior who embraced his true self.
