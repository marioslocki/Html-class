            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>How you can become the Light for everyone!</p>
            <p>From a young age I always admired the elegant style, the fancy clothes , Reading books , Beeing of help to others and teaching others to help also in general.
                 When I was watching TV or movies the main character was always unique in a sense that I couldn't really recognise.
                  Was it the way he speaks? The clothes? His humour? His intelligence? As I was growing up I realised part of it was his external appearance.
                   But what made them unique was never something specific as a watch or a bracelet. 
                   But his boldness to be unique and his courage to be the center of attention.
                    without caring if he will be judged or fear what people might say about him. 
                    It was that strong sense of reality that made everyone else succumb to his extraordinary personality. 
                    It was that confidence that radiated from miles away.His care for others without thinking of what they are saying about him. 
                     His nonchalant attitude that made everyone think that he has somesecret power. 
                    That he knows something others don't. When he was walking had a different aura. 
                    Giving the feeling of grandiosity in a way that noone could explain but everyone could feel.
                     It is all that feelings that were created in the people's hearts and minds what made a star in the end.
